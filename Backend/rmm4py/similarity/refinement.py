def compute(trace_1, trace_2):
    """
    Check if one trace is an refinement of another, i.e. they have a common subsequence of activities
    (control-flow only).
    True if one sequence can be transformed to the other only by inserting activities.

    0 if not refinement
    1 if completely equal
    1 - (#insertion/max(trace length)) otherwise

    For example:
    trace_1 = a, b, c, h, i ,j
    trace_2 = a, b, c, d, e, f, h, i ,j
    returns 3/9

    while

    Parameters
    ----------
    trace_1:    Trace
                Input trace 1

    trace_2:    Trace
                Input trace 2

    Returns
    -------
    int
                similarity as a score between 0 and 1

    Compute the difference between trace 1 and trace 2, i.e. what insertions or deletions are required to
    transform 1 into 2.
    If the shorter trace cannot be transformed into the other simply be adding events, False is returned to signal
    a problem.
    Otherwise, the list of activities required will be returned.

    ----------
    trace_1:    Trace
                Input trace 1

    Returns
    -------
    Tuple of lists: list
